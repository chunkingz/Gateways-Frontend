# Gateways Frontend (Musala Soft Fullstack Developer Assessment)

This sample project is about managing gateways - master devices that control multiple peripheral devices.

The task is to create a REST service for storing information about these gateways and their associated devices. This information must be stored in the database.

When storing a gateway, any field marked as “to be validated” must be validated and an error returned if it is invalid. Also, no more that 10 peripheral devices are allowed for a gateway.

The service must also offer an operation for displaying information about all stored gateways (and their devices) and an operation for displaying details for a single gateway. Finally, it must be possible to add and remove a device from a gateway.
